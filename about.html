                                create one! MyFitness Suites is a fitness facility that provides a mix of instructor-led
                                classes for improved strength, endurance, flexibility, and wellness. Mix and match
                                weight training, boot camp, hot yoga, HIIT, hot barre, pilates, functional fitness, and
                                more. Our classes cost less than a babysitter and we offer that to our members for free!
